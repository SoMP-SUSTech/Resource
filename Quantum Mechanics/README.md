# Seminar on Quantum Mechanics

This is the note for a seminar on Quantum Mechanics in the spring semester, 2020. The seminar is mainly aimed for people interested in quantum mechanics with mathematical background. The lectures will focus on the algebraic structures in quantum mechanics, rather than talking about the PDEs or using methods in functional analysis, for there have already been lots of books in such topics.
