\section*{Introduction}
This thesis will give an introduction to basic category theory, and show how category theory might be related or applied to abstract algebra by several examples and propositions. Also, we would mention some notions about abstract algebra which aren't mentioned in the course, and some notions in topology theory. \par
We would admit facts in set theory and assume the axiom of choice. We would make definitions and notations as detailed as possible, but omit proofs for simple facts, give references or proofs with details omitted for complicated theorems like the Yoneda Lemma. The main references of this thesis are Riehl, Emily. \textsl{Category Theory in Context}, Aluffi, Paolo. \textsl{Algebra: Chapter 0} and Munkres, James. \textsl{Topology}.
